# C# Class

A class is like a blueprint of a specific object. In the real world, every object has some color, shape, and functionalities - for example, the luxury car Ferrari. Ferrari is an object of the luxury car type. The luxury car is a class that indicates some characteristics like speed, color, shape, interior, etc. So any company that makes a car that meets those requirements is an object of the luxury car type. For example, every single car of BMW, Lamborghini, Cadillac are an object of the class called 'Luxury Car'. Here, 'Luxury Car' is a class, and every single physical car is an object of the luxury car class.

Likewise, in object-oriented programming, a class defines some properties, fields, events, methods, etc. A class defines the kinds of data and the functionality their objects will have.

A class enables you to create your custom types by grouping variables of other types, methods, and events. 

Example: MyClass.cs
